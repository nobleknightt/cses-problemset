# Reachability Queries 

A directed graph consists of ```n``` nodes and ```m``` edges. The edges are numbered ```1,2,\dots,n```.
Your task is to answer ```q``` queries of the form "can you reach node ```b``` from node ```a```?"
## Input
- The first input line has three integers ```n```, ```m``` and ```q```: the number of nodes, edges and queries.
Then there are ```m``` lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers ```a``` and ```b```: there is an edge from node ```a``` to node ```b```.
Finally there are ```q``` lines describing the queries. Each line consists of two integers ```a``` and ```b```: "can you reach node ```b``` from node ```a```?"
## Output
- Print the answer for each query: either "YES" or "NO".
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^4```
- ```1 \le m,q \le 10^5```

## Example
Input:
```
4 4 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
4 3
1 3
1 4
4 1
```

Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```
