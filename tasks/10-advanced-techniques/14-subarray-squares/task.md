# Subarray Squares 

Given an array of ```n``` elements, your task is to divide into ```k``` subarrays. The cost of each subarray is the square of the sum of the values in the subarray. What is the minimum total cost if you act optimally?
## Input
- The first input line has two integers ```n``` and ```k```: the array elements and the number of subarrays. The array elements are numbered ```1,2,\dots,n```.
The second line has ```n``` integers ```x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n```: the contents of the array.
## Output
- Print one integer: the minimum total cost.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le k \le n \le 3000```
- ```1 \le x_i \le 10^5```

## Example
Input:
```
8 3
2 3 1 2 2 3 4 1
```

Output:
```
110
```

Explanation: An optimal solution is ```[2,3,1]```, ```[2,2,3]```, ```[4,1]```, whose cost is ```(2+3+1)^2+(2+2+3)^2+(4+1)^2=110```.
