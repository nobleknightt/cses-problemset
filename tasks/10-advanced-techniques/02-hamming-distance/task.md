# Hamming Distance 

The Hamming distance between two strings ```a``` and ```b``` of equal length is the number of positions where the strings differ.
You are given ```n``` bit strings, each of length ```k``` and your task is to calculate the minimum Hamming distance between two strings.
## Input
- The first input line has two integers ```n``` and ```k```: the number of bit strings and their length.
Then there are ```n``` lines each consisting of one bit string of length ```k```.
## Output
- Print the minimum Hamming distance between two strings.
## Constraints

- ```2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^4```
- ```1 \le k \le 30```

## Example
Input:
```
5 6
110111
001000
100001
101000
101110
```

Output:
```
1
```

Explanation: The strings 101000 and 001000 differ only at the first position.
