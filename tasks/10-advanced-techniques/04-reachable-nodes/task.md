# Reachable Nodes 

A directed acyclic graph consists of ```n``` nodes and ```m``` edges. The nodes are numbered ```1,2,\dots,n```.
Calculate for each node the number of nodes you can reach from that node (including the node itself).
## Input
- The first input line has two integers ```n``` and ```m```: the number of nodes and edges.
Then there are ```m``` lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers ```a``` and ```b```: there is an edge from node ```a``` to node ```b```.
## Output
- Print ```n``` integers: for each node the number of reachable nodes.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^4```
- ```1 \le m \le 10^5```

## Example
Input:
```
5 6
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
3 5
4 5
```

Output:
```
5 3 2 2 1
```
