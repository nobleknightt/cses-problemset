# Sliding Window Cost 

You are given an array of ```n``` integers. Your task is to calculate for each window of ```k``` elements, from left to right, the minimum total cost of making all elements equal.
You can increase or decrease each element with cost ```x``` where ```x``` is the difference between the new and the original value. The total cost is the sum of such costs.
## Input
- The first input line contains two integers ```n``` and ```k```: the number of elements and the size of the window.
Then there are ```n``` integers ```x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n```: the contents of the array.
## Output
- Output ```n-k+1``` values: the costs.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5```
- ```1 \le x_i \le 10^9```

## Example
Input:
```
8 3
2 4 3 5 8 1 2 1
```

Output:
```
2 2 5 7 7 1
```
