# Factory Machines 

A factory has ```n``` machines which can be used to make products. Your goal is to make a total of ```t``` products.
For each machine, you know the number of seconds it needs to make a single product. The machines can work simultaneously, and you can freely decide their schedule.
What is the shortest time needed to make ```t``` products?
## Input
- The first input line has two integers ```n``` and ```t```: the number of machines and products.
The next line has ```n``` integers ```k_1,k_2,\dots,k_n```: the time needed to make a product using each machine.
## Output
- Print one integer: the minimum time needed to make ```t``` products.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5```
- ```1 \le t \le 10^9```
- ```1 \le k_i \le 10^9```

## Example
Input:
```
3 7
3 2 5
```

Output:
```
8
```

Explanation: Machine 1 makes two products, machine 2 makes four products and machine 3 makes one product.
