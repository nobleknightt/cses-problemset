# Subarray Distinct Values 

Given an array of ```n``` integers, your task is to calculate the number of subarrays that have at most ```k``` distinct values.
## Input
- The first input line has two integers ```n``` and ```k```.
The next line has ```n``` integers ```x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n```: the contents of the array.
## Output
- Print one integer: the number of subarrays.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5```
- ```1 \le x_i \le 10^9```

## Example
Input:
```
5 2
1 2 3 1 1
```

Output:
```
10
```
