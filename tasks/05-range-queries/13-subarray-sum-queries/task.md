# Subarray Sum Queries 

There is an array consisting of ```n``` integers. Some values of the array will be updated, and after each update, your task is to report the maximum subarray sum in the array.
## Input
- The first input line contains integers ```n``` and ```m```: the size of the array and the number of updates. The array is indexed ```1,2,\ldots,n```.
The next line has ```n``` integers: ```x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n```: the initial contents of the array.
Then there are ```m``` lines describing the changes. Each line has two integers ```k``` and ```x```: the value at position ```k``` becomes ```x```.
## Output
- After each update, print the maximum subarray sum. Empty subarrays (with sum ```0```) are allowed.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5```
- ```-10^9 \le x_i \le 10^9```
- ```1 \le k \le n```
- ```-10^9 \le x \le 10^9```

## Example
Input:
```
5 3
1 2 -3 5 -1
2 6
3 1
2 -2
```

Output:
```
9
13
6
```
