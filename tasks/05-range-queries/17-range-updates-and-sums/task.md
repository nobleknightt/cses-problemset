# Range Updates and Sums 

Your task is to maintain an array of ```n``` values and efficiently process the following types of queries:

- Increase each value in range ```[a,b]``` by ```x```.
- Set each value in range ```[a,b]``` to ```x```.
- Calculate the sum of values in range ```[a,b]```.

## Input
- The first input line has two integers ```n``` and ```q```: the array size and the number of queries.
The next line has ```n``` values ```t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n```: the initial contents of the array.
Finally, there are ```q``` lines describing the queries. The format of each line is one of the following: "1 ```a``` ```b``` ```x```",  "2 ```a``` ```b``` ```x```", or "3 ```a``` ```b```".
## Output
- Print the answer to each sum query.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5```
- ```1 \le t_i, x \le 10^6```
- ```1 \le a \le b \le n```

## Example
Input:
```
6 5
2 3 1 1 5 3
3 3 5
1 2 4 2
3 3 5
2 2 4 5
3 3 5
```

Output:
```
7
11
15
```
