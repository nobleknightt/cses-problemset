# Pattern Positions 

Given a string and patterns, find for each pattern the first position (1-indexed) where it appears in the string.
## Input
- The first input line has a string of length ```n```.
The next input line has an integer ```k```: the number of patterns. Finally, there are ```k``` lines that describe the patterns.
The string and the patterns consist of characters aâ€“z.
## Output
- Print the first position for each pattern (or ```-1``` if it does not appear at all).
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^5```
- ```1 \le k \le 5 \cdot 10^5```
- the total length of the patterns is at most ```5 \cdot 10^5```

## Example
Input:
```
aybabtu
3
bab
abc
a
```

Output:
```
3
-1
1
```
