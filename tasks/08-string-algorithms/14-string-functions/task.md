# String Functions 

We consider a string of ```n``` characters, indexed ```1,2,\dots,n```. Your task is to calculate all values of the following functions:

- ```z(i)``` denotes the maximum length of a substring that begins at position ```i``` and is a prefix of the string. In addition, ```z(1)=0```.
- ```\pi(i)``` denotes the maximum length of a substring that ends at position ```i```, is a prefix of the string, and whose length is at most ```i-1```.

Note that the function ```z``` is used in the Z-algorithm, and the function ```\pi``` is used in the KMP algorithm.
## Input
- The only input line has a string of length ```n```. Each character is between aâ€“z.
## Output
- Print two lines: first the values of the ```z``` function, and then the values of the ```\pi``` function.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
abaabca
```

Output:
```
0 0 1 2 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 2 0 1
```
