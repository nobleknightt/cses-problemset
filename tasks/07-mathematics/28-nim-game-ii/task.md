# Nim Game II 

There are ```n``` heaps of sticks and two players who move alternately. On each move, a player chooses a non-empty heap and removes ```1```, ```2```, or ```3``` sticks. The player who removes the last stick wins the game.
Your task is to find out who wins if both players play optimally.
## Input
- The first input line contains an integer ```t```: the number of tests. After this, ```t``` test cases are described:
The first line contains an integer ```n```: the number of heaps.
The next line has ```n``` integers ```x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n```: the number of sticks in each heap.
## Output
- For each test case, print "first" if the first player wins the game and "second" if the second player wins the game.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5```
- ```1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5```
- ```1 \le x_i \le 10^9```
- the sum of all ```n``` is at most ```2 \cdot 10^5```

## Example
Input:
```
3
4
5 7 2 5
2
4 1
3
4 4 4
```

Output:
```
first
