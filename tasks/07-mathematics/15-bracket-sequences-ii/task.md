# Bracket Sequences II 

Your task is to calculate the number of valid bracket sequences of length ```n``` when a prefix of the sequence is given.
## Input
- The first input line has an integer ```n```.
The second line has a string of ```k``` characters: the prefix of the sequence.
## Output
- Print the number of sequences modulo ```10^9+7```.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le k \le n \le 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
6
(()
```

Output:
```
2
```

Explanation: There are two possible sequences: (())() and (()()).
