# Distributing Apples 

There are ```n``` children and ```m``` apples that will be distributed to them. Your task is to count the number of ways this can be done.
For example, if ```n=3``` and ```m=2```, there are ```6``` ways: ```[0,0,2]```, ```[0,1,1]```, ```[0,2,0]```, ```[1,0,1]```, ```[1,1,0]``` and ```[2,0,0]```.
## Input
- The only input line has two integers ```n``` and ```m```.
## Output
- Print the number of ways modulo ```10^9+7```.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n,m \le 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
3 2
```

Output:
```
6
```
