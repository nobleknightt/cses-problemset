# Binomial Coefficients 

Your task is to calculate ```n``` binomial coefficients modulo ```10^9+7```.
A binomial coefficient ```{a \choose b}``` can be calculated using the formula ```\frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!}```. We assume that ```a``` and ```b``` are integers and ```0 \le b \le a```.
## Input
- The first input line contains an integer ```n```: the number of calculations.
After this, there are ```n``` lines, each of which contains two integers ```a``` and ```b```.
## Output
- Print each binomial coefficient modulo ```10^9+7```.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^5```
- ```0 \le b \le a \le 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
3
5 3
8 1
9 5
```

Output:
```
10
8
126
```
