# Exponentiation II 

Your task is to efficiently calculate values ```a^{b^c}``` modulo ```10^9+7```.
Note that in this task we assume that ```0^0=1```.
## Input
- The first input line has an integer ```n```: the number of calculations.
After this, there are ```n``` lines, each containing three integers ```a```, ```b``` and ```c```.
## Output
- Print each value ```a^{b^c}``` modulo ```10^9+7```.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^5```
- ```0 \le a,b,c \le 10^9```

## Example
Input:
```
3
3 7 1
15 2 2
3 4 5
```

Output:
```
2187
50625
763327764
```
