# Moving Robots 

Each square of an ```8 \times 8``` chessboard has a robot. Each robot independently moves ```k``` steps, and there can be many robots on the same square.
On each turn, a robot moves one step left, right, up or down, but not outside the board. It randomly chooses a direction among those where it can move.
Your task is to calculate the expected number of empty squares after ```k``` turns.
## Input
- The only input line has an integer ```k```.
## Output
- Print the expected number of empty squares rounded to six decimal places (rounding half to even).
## Constraints

- ```1 \le k \le 100```

## Example
Input:
```
10
```

Output:
```
23.120740
```
