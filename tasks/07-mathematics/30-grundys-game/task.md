# Grundy's Game 

There is a heap of ```n``` coins and two players who move alternately. On each move, a player chooses a heap and divides into two nonempty heaps that have a different number of coins. The player who makes the last move wins the game.
Your task is to find out who wins if both players play optimally.
## Input
- The first input line contains an integer ```t```: the number of tests.
After this, there are ```t``` lines that describe the tests. Each line has an integer ```n```: the number of coins in the initial heap.
## Output
- For each test case, print "first" if the first player wins the game and "second" if the second player wins the game.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le t \le 10^5```
- ```1 \le n \le 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
3
6
7
8
```

Output:
```
first
second
first
```
