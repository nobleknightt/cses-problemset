# Shortest Subsequence 

You are given a DNA sequence consisting of characters A, C, G, and T.
Your task is to find the shortest DNA sequence that is not a subsequence of the original sequence.
## Input
- The only input line contains a DNA sequence with ```n``` characters.
## Output
- Print the shortest DNA sequence that is not a subsequence of the original sequence. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
ACGTACGT
```

Output:
```
AAA
