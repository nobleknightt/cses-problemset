# Filling Trominos 

Your task is to fill an ```n \times m``` grid using L-trominos (three squares that have an L-shape). For example, here is one way to fill a ```4 \times 6``` grid:

## Input
- The first input line has an integer ```t```: the number of tests.
After that, there are ```t``` lines that describe the tests. Each line has two integers ```n``` and ```m```.
## Output
- For each test, print YES if there is a solution, and NO otherwise.
If there is a solution, also print ```n``` lines that each contain ```m``` letters between Aâ€“Z. Adjacent squares must have the same letter exactly when they belong to the same tromino. You can print any valid solution.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le t \le 100```
- ```1 \le n,m \le 100```

## Example
Input:
```
2
4 6
4 7
```

Output:
```
YES
AADDBB
ACCDEB
BCAEEC
BBAACC
NO
```
