# Counting Reorders 

Calculate the number of ways you can reorder the characters of a string so that no two adjacent characters are the same.
For example, the answer for aabc is ```6```, because the possible orders are abac, abca, acab, acba, baca, and caba.
## Input
- The only input line has a string that consists of ```n``` characters between aâ€“z.
## Output
- Print an integer: the answer modulo ```10^9+7```.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 5000```

## Example
Input:
```
aabc
```

Output:
```
6
```
