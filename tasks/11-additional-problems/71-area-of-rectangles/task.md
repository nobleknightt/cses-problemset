# Area of Rectangles 

Given ```n``` rectangles, your task is to determine the total area of their union.
## Input
- The first input line has an integer ```n```: the number of rectangles.
After that, there are ```n``` lines describing the rectangles. Each line has four integers ```x_1```, ```y_1```, ```x_2``` and ```y_2```: a rectangle begins at point ```(x_1,y_1)``` and ends at point ```(x_2,y_2)```.
## Output
- Print the total area covered by the rectangles.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^5```
- ```-10^6 \le x_1 < x_2 \le 10^6```
- ```-10^6 \le y_1 < y_2 \le 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
3
1 3 4 5
3 1 7 4
5 3 8 6
```

Output:
```
24
```
