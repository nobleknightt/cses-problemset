# Permutations II 

A permutation of integers ```1,2,\ldots,n``` is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements whose difference is ```1```.
Given ```n```, your task is to count the number of beautiful permutations.
## Input
- The only input line contains an integer ```n```.
## Output
- Print the number of beautiful permutations of ```1,2,\ldots,n``` modulo ```10^9+7```.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 1000```

## Example
Input:
```
5
```

Output:
```
14
```
