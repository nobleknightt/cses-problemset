# String Transform 

Consider the following string transformation:

- append the character # to the string (we assume that # is lexicographically smaller than all other characters of the string)
- generate all rotations of the string
- sort the rotations in increasing order
- based on this order, construct a new string that contains the last character of each rotation

For example, the string babc becomes babc#. Then, the sorted list of rotations is #babc, abc#b, babc#, bc#ba, and c#bab. This yields a string cb#ab.
## Input
- The only input line contains the transformed string of length ```n+1```. Each character of the original string is one of a–z.
## Output
- Print the original string of length ```n```.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
cb#ab
```

Output:
```
babc
```
