# Tree Traversals 

There are three common ways to traverse the nodes of a binary tree:

- Preorder: First process the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- Inorder: First process the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
- Postorder: First process the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.

There is a binary tree of ```n``` nodes with distinct labels. You are given the preorder and inorder traversals of the tree, and your task is to determine its postorder traversal.
## Input
- The first input line has an integer ```n```: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered ```1,2,\dots,n```.
After this, there are two lines describing the preorder and inorder traversals of the tree. Both lines consist of ```n``` integers.
You can assume that the input corresponds to a binary tree.
## Output
- Print the postorder traversal of the tree.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^5```

## Example
Input:
```
5
5 3 2 1 4
3 5 1 2 4
```

Output:
```
3 1 4 2 5
```
