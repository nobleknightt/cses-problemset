# Network Breakdown 

Syrj채l채's network has ```n``` computers and ```m``` connections between them. The network consists of components of computers that can send messages to each other.
Nobody in Syrj채l채 understands how the network works. For this reason, if a connection breaks down, nobody will repair it. In this situation a component may be divided into two components.
Your task is to calculate the number of components after each connection breakdown.
## Input
- The first input line has three integers ```n```, ```m``` and ```k```: the number of computers, connections and breakdowns. The computers are numbered ```1,2,\dots,n```.
Then, there are ```m``` lines describing the connections. Each line has two integers ```a``` and ```b```: there is a connection between computers ```a``` and ```b```. Each connection is between two different computers, and there is at most one connection between two computers.
Finally, there are ```k``` lines describing the breakdowns. Each line has two integers ```a``` and ```b```: the connection between computers ```a``` and ```b``` breaks down.
## Output
- After each breakdown, print the number of components.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 10^5```
- ```1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5```
- ```1 \le k \le m```
- ```1 \le a,b \le n```

## Example
Input:
```
5 5 3
1 2
1 3
2 3
3 4
4 5
3 4
2 3
4 5
```

Output:
```
2 2 3
```
