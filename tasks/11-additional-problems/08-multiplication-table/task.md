# Multiplication Table 

Find the middle element when the numbers in an ```n \times n``` multiplication table are sorted in increasing order. It is assumed that ```n``` is odd.
For example, the ```3 \times 3``` multiplication table is as follows:
123246369```
\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 4 & 6 \\
3 & 6 & 9 \\
\end{matrix}
```
The numbers in increasing order are ```[1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9]```, so the answer is ```3```.
## Input
- The only input line has an integer ```n```.
## Output
- Print one integer: the answer to the task.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n < 10^6```

## Example
Input:
```
3
```

Output:
```
3
```
