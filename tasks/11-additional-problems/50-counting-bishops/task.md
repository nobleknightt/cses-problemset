# Counting Bishops 

Your task is to count the number of ways ```k``` bishops can be placed on an ```n \times n``` chessboard so that no two bishops attack each other.
Two bishops attack each other if they are on the same diagonal.
## Input
- The only input line has two integers ```n``` and ```k```: the board size and the number of bishops.
## Output
- Print one integer: the number of ways modulo ```10^9+7```.
## Constraints

- ```1 \le n \le 500```
- ```1 \le k \le n^2```

## Example
Input:
```
5 4
```

Output:
```
2728
```
